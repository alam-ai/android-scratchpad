# Scratch Pad

Scratch Pad is a minimalist whiteboard app. Use it as you would use scratch paper.

## Features
* **Pen**, **Eraser**, and **Clear All** to quickly start a new scratch - simple and minimalist
* **Pan** and **zoom** using two fingers - you have as much as space for your scratch as you need
* Back gesture disabled so drawing near the left/right edge does not accidentally close app
* No ads - screen space is all for your scratch work
